# 📂 Image Preprocessing Techniques 🖼️
Welcome to my Image Preprocessing Repository! 🚀 Here, I have uploaded various techniques used to preprocess images before feeding them into machine learning and deep learning models.

## What’s Inside?
1. Image mean and standard deviation calculation for normlizing the image.

## Why is Image Preprocessing Important?
Preprocessing helps in improving model accuracy, reducing noise, and making the model more robust to variations in input data.
