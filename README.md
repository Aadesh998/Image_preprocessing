# 📂 Image Preprocessing Techniques 🖼️
Welcome to my Image Preprocessing Repository! 🚀 Here, I have uploaded various techniques used to preprocess images before feeding them into machine learning and deep learning models.

##🔹 What’s Inside?
✔️ Image Normalization (Min-Max, Z-score, etc.)
✔️ Image Resizing & Cropping
✔️ Image Denoising & Smoothing
✔️ Image Augmentation (Rotation, Flipping, Brightness Adjustments, etc.)
✔️ Histogram Equalization & Contrast Enhancement
✔️ And more...

##🔹 Why is Image Preprocessing Important?
Preprocessing helps in improving model accuracy, reducing noise, and making the model more robust to variations in input data.
